    <h1>William Shakespeare, Shakespeare also spelled Shakspere, byname Bard of Avon or Swan of Avon, (baptized April
        26, 1564, Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, England—died April 23, 1616, Stratford-upon-Avon), English poet,
        dramatist, and actor often called the English national poet and considered by many to be the greatest dramatist
        of all time.

        Shakespeare occupies a position unique in world literature. Other poets, such as Homer and Dante, and novelists,
        such as Leo Tolstoy and Charles Dickens, have transcended national barriers, but no writer’s living reputation
        can compare to that of Shakespeare, whose plays, written in the late 16th and early 17th centuries for a small
        repertory theatre, are now performed and read more often and in more countries than ever before. The prophecy of
        his great contemporary, the poet and dramatist Ben Jonson, that Shakespeare “was not of an age, but for all
        time,” has been fulfilled.</h1>
